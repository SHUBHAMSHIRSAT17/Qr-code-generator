# Qr-code-generator
python project
A QR code generator using Python and Tkinter is a simple application that allows users to input text or data, and then converts it into a QR code. Tkinter is used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application, making it easy for users to interact with the program. The generated QR code can then be saved as an image file for sharing or printing. This type of application can be useful for creating QR codes for websites, contact information, or any other data that needs to be easily scanned and shared.
